<p>
<ul>I am car enthusaist! I love everything about cars, to drive and hear thier crazy sound, i'm adrenalin junkie i love that feeling, my passion to cars is because the Fast and Furious star Paul Walker who passed away on 2013, Paul Walker was my childhood hero since 2002, he's my role model and every car enthusaist in the world loves him, on saturdays me and my friends go out with our vehicles to drive sporty on the beautiful roads of Ramat hagolan, Elkosh, Switzerland forest they are very challenging roads to drive, my own car is a Volkswagen Polo GTI Mark 6 2018, details of the car: 2.0 liter engine turbo charged create 200 horsepower and 32.2 torque all the force goes the front wheels by DUAL CLUTCH TRANSMISSION(DCT), also the car has a Electronic differential lock(XDS) to support the rear wheels on track circuit and curved roads, the XDS acts as a limited slip differential to compensate for the understeer typical of front wheel drive(FWD) cars during fast cornering, Thanks to XDS, handling becomes more precise and more neutral, the Polo GTI weight is 1,280kg because of the light weight, the car reach's to 0-100 KM/H in 6 seconds.<p><video controls class="videos" src="2.mp4"</ul>
